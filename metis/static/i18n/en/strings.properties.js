proposal_info1 = Metis Protocol is a second layer protocol built on Ethereum. Based on Metis Protocol, anyone can build up a DAC to collaborate with other distributed parties to achieve a business goal, and to manage the collaboration process transparently and efficiently.
proposal_info2 = Metis Protocol defines Meta Staking Contract (MSC) for the DAC governance, which is acting as the traditional Company Law. Referring to the algorithm of Optimistic Rollup, Metis Protocol leverages the staking deposit as the guarantee for each Meta Collaborator to act as their promise. In order to protect the interest of all the collaboration parties, MSC has a very important mechanism of pullback and arbitration to punish the party who couldn’t fulfill its promise. Thus, Metis Protocol enables every distributed party to establish a collaborative relationship with another party in an easy, protectable and permissionless way.
proposal_info3 = Metis Protocol defines ComCo Management Framework to manage the collaboration process. Within the ComCo Management Framework, Jobs Statement Contract (JSC) is used to define the milestones that each party has agreed on, Microservice Tools Pool (MTP)  is used to provide microservices tools for executing activities. Based on the execution results, the ComCo Management Framework will call Meta Staking Contract to initiate the Token Incentives or Arbitration.
proposal_info4 = Metis Lab, initiated by the founding partners, is the first member of Metis DAC.
proposal_info5 = In the Stone Age and Bronze Age, Metis Lab will be the main contributor to advance the development and application of the Metis Protocol. With more members joining the Metis DAC, Metis Ecosystem Development Committee will be elected to manage and operate the Metis DAC.
